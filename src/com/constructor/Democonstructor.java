/*
 
 * A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:
 * Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have
 * a return type (like void).
 * 
 * Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.
